* Add application icon

Project Goals
-------------
The goal of this project is to make the PaperBack project compatible with Visual Studio and modern C++ standards so that it may be compiled without the Borland compiler. This will allow for easier development of additional features such as native x64 support, improved UI, and more.

Compilation
-------------
1. Clone or download repository zip.
2. Install Visual Studio 2022 (Community Edition without logging in is fine)
3. Install the following Visual Studio components: Desktop development with C++, C++ MFC for latest v143 build tools (x86 & x64)
4. Open mrpods.sln solution
5. Build / build + run

Changelog
---------
Version 1.10 - Initial release. Based off PaperBack v1.10. AES functionality is commented out at the moment, and there is no graceful handling of existing AES documents from PaperBack.

Similar Tools (Not Recommended)
-------------
The following tools are either failed attempts to rewrite PaperBack or do not contain all of the features and functionality that the original software provides - a rough 17 years.
