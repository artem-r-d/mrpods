TODO: 
* Reimplement or remove AES functionality
* Fix an overwrite existing files bug
* Clean up x86 Release

Project Goals
-------------
The goal of this project is to make the PaperBack project compatible with Visual Studio and modern C++ standards so that it may be compiled without the Borland compiler. This will allow for easier development of additional features such as native x64 support, improved UI, and more.

Changelog
---------
Version 1.10 - Initial release. Based off PaperBack v1.10. AES functionality is commented out at the moment, and there is no graceful handling of existing AES documents from PaperBack.

Similar Tools (Not Recommended)
-------------
The following tools are either failed attempts to rewrite PaperBack or do not contain all of the features and functionality that the original software provides - a rough 17 years.
